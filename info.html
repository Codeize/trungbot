                    TrungBot is a multipurpose bot which is dedicated to serving <strong>you</strong>, the ordinary Discord user!
                    <br><br>
                    <h1> Quick Overview </h1>
                    TrungBot has features including: Moderation tools, miscellaneous tools, profile (information) tools, image manipulation, subreddits, and most importantly, minigames! The bot is created by the discord user Trung_ (Trung_#3765), and in addition, <a href="./team.html">the team</a>
                    <h1>History</h1>
                    <h2>Backstory</h2>
                    Trung, the owner and developer of the bot, was given inspiration from the bot, 3vilbot, which was and is now still used in the server Dani's Basement.
                    <h2>Beginning</h2>
                    TrungBot was created on June 17th 2020 by Trung_. It was mainly used in one of Trung's online friends' server and was also used to show general information about things on it as well, such as user information and server information.
                    <br> <br>
                    TrungBot then was quickly shifted to more commands that had a purpose for leisure, such as subreddits and jokes, as well as basic moderation. TrungBot's support server was then created on July 17th, 2020, just soon a month after.
                    <br><br>
                    TrungBot was first announced its update on image commands on August 28th, with its first image command as "t!yankee". It wasn't soon after when more image manipulation tools, which were made under the influence of internet memes, were created for the Discord user to enjoy. Most popular commands include: t!demotivation, t!makememe, t!yankee... 
                    <h2>Minigames</h2>
                    On September 20th, Trung had an idea: to make his bot run games.
                    <br><br>
                    The first minigame which Trung tried to recreate was Tic Tac Toe. After 6 days, it was finally done and was ready for release... Well at least he thought it would. Even though Trung had taken only less than a week to finish the task, there were many bugs and unwanted features that came with it. In the end, Tic Tac Toe was archived for further development in the future.
                    The second game did not go so well too. Trung tried to recreate Snake... but failed miserably afterwards.
                    <br><br>
                    The third game, however, Trung tried to recreate a normal game of Rock Paper Scissors, which surprisingly went well. This gave Trung motivation to continue doing other commands.
                    <br><br>
                    The fourth game was the big leap: Hangman. After messing around for only a few days, it was finally added to the bot. Many people liked hangman, and gave several feedbacks to make it better. The fifth game, which was 2048, came out a bit later. Nonetheless, only under a day, 2048 was quickly developed and was brought to life on February 7th 2021.
